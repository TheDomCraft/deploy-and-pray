# 🌐 deployandpray.online

Welcome to **deployandpray.online** – a chaotic-neutral domain service for developers who just want to get their side projects online without buying a domain every time.

> "Why test locally when you can test in production? Real devs deploy and pray."

## 🧠 About This Project

As a developer, I often spin up small side projects, experiments, and hobby tools – most of which don’t justify buying a full domain.  
That’s why I created **deployandpray.online**:  
To offer a free, subdomain-based DNS service for fellow devs who just want a `.online` endpoint for their code.

Whether you're building something serious or completely stupid, you’re welcome here.

## 🚀 Get Your Own Subdomain

Need something like `mytool.deployandpray.online` or `ironicservice.deployandpray.online`?

### It’s 100% free – here’s how to request it:

1. 📝 **Fill out this form** with your project name, desired subdomain, and the IP address it should point to:  
   👉 [Request Form](https://forms.gle/K9ZDfGCntGukTA8L7)

2. 📩 I’ll review your request manually. If everything looks good, I’ll configure the DNS and notify you by email.

3. 🧨 Once live, your project is publicly available under your chosen subdomain.

## ✅ Requirements & Notes

- Your project must be reachable by IP (A/AAAA record). No domain forwarding.
- No illegal content, phishing, crypto scams, tracking/spam pages, or AI grifts.
- Subdomains are granted on a **first-come, first-serve** basis.
- This is a manual process – please be patient. I'm just one dev.

## 🙌 Why I'm Doing This

I know how annoying it can be to:
- repeatedly buy throwaway domains for small projects
- set up DNS for something you’ll demo once and forget

So I made this project to help others like me get their stuff online faster – without worrying about the boring parts.

If you like what I'm doing, feel free to star this repo or share it with others. No obligations.
